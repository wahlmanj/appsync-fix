appsync-fix
===========

This is a quick IOS 7 appsync fix when your native apps stop working due to appsync

Not everyone uses appsync for pirated apps. I for one use it to install non approved apps removed from the AppStore like the old wifi analyzer that is a very useful wifi tool.

After you remove appsync copy native.bash to your root directory / do these commands to easily fix your native apps:

login
cd /
chmod +x native.bash
./native.bash
